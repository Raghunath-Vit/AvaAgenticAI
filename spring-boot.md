# Spring Boot
## Key Features
- Convention over configuration for rapid development
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) for standalone applications
- Auto-configuration to reduce boilerplate code
- Production-ready features (metrics, health checks, externalized configuration)
- Wide integration with Spring ecosystem and third-party libraries
- Minimal XML configuration
- Starter dependencies for simplified dependency management

## Use Cases
- Building RESTful APIs and microservices
- Developing enterprise web applications
- Rapid prototyping of Java-based backend services
- Creating cloud-native applications
- Batch processing and scheduled tasks

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Java programming language
- Familiarity with Maven or Gradle for dependency management
- Understanding of Spring Framework fundamentals (optional but beneficial)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Next Steps
- Install Spring Boot CLI or use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to bootstrap a new project
- Explore official documentation and guides (https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- Build and run a simple REST API to get hands-on experience
- Learn about Spring Boot Actuator for production monitoring
- Experiment with integrating databases and security modules

## Potential Applications
- Large-scale enterprise systems with modular microservices
- Cloud-deployed applications leveraging containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- IoT backend platforms for device management and data ingestion
- Fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce platforms requiring scalable Java backends
- Rapid MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development for startups and innovation teams
